          <h1>Building a mentoring tool to strengthen teacher-student relationships during the pandemic</h1>
          <p className="lede">
            When classrooms went remote, teachers lost the small moments that build trust: the hallway check-ins, the quick conversations before class. As lead product designer, I built the visual foundation, component system, and core flows for Along, a tool that recreates those moments through structured prompts and asynchronous reflection.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            When schools shifted to remote learning, the informal moments of connection between teachers and students disappeared. The quick check-ins before class, the hallway conversations. These small interactions that build trust and understanding were suddenly gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along also represented a strategic shift for CZI's education team. Our existing products followed a school leader adoption model, where district and principal buy-in drove usage. Along was different: a teacher-first product where individual educators could sign up and start using it on their own. This was a new go-to-market motion for the org, which meant the product had to be simple enough to onboard without training and compelling enough to spread through word of mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We needed to create a space where meaningful mentorship moments could happen asynchronously, respecting both teachers' limited time and students' varied schedules and comfort levels.

          <h2>Visual Elements for Initial Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            I established the core visual elements (color, typography, iconography, and component patterns) that would carry across the product. This wasn't a full design system yet. It was a working vocabulary: flexible enough to test ideas quickly, consistent enough that flows would feel unified from prototype to production.

            I led the type exploration and recommended Moranga as the display typeface, a rounded serif by Latinotype that balances lighthearted fun with credibility. The warm, rounded serifs and teardrop terminals give it personality without sacrificing legibility, exactly the tone Along needed: approachable but not childish, warm but not soft.

            I built out a component library that could flex across student and teacher experiences while maintaining visual consistency.

          <h2>Mapping the Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Teachers who made it through were seeing real results: students opening up, relationships strengthening. But we were losing too many along the way. Our v1 onboarding asked too much upfront, and teachers with packed schedules were dropping off before sending their first prompt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using service blueprinting, I mapped the full onboarding flow from school leader signup, through teacher account creation, to a student receiving their first question. This became the artifact I used to align engineering, product, and our school partnerships team across a few workshops.
          </p>
          <p>
            In ed tech product environments, back-to-school season is a critical narrow window to ship products and new features. Teachers were setting up classrooms, syncing rosters from Clever, deciding which tools would earn a place in their already-overloaded workflow. We needed to make Along feel effortless at exactly the moment they were most overwhelmed.

            Beyond the core flows, I worked through the less obvious states: what happens when content is blocked, how notifications surface without overwhelming, how the navigation scales as conversations accumulate.

            <h2>Designing the Content Library</h2>
            <p>
              The Content Library was the heart of the teacher experience, the place where they'd browse collections and pick questions to send to students. I owned the visual direction: a softer palette than a typical edtech tool, generous whitespace, and typography that felt inviting rather than institutional.
            </p>
            <p>
              The library organized questions into themed collections: "Getting acquainted," "Build a learning community," "Values and interests." Some teachers wanted light check-ins; others wanted questions that opened deeper territory. I worked with our education content specialist to design a hierarchy that surfaced both without making the heavier topics feel intimidating.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also designed for progress and personalization. A simple checkbox helped teachers track which questions they'd already sent, and a Favorites feature let them save questions they wanted to return to, building a personal library over time.
            </p>

          <h2>Question-Led vs. Collection-Led</h2>
          <p>
            A core tension emerged in the early prototyping: should we lead with questions or collections? I tested three directions. Leading with collections prioritized clear entry points and optimized for browsing. Leading with questions surfaced content directly, reducing clicks to send. Adding filters and depth tagging let teachers narrow by tone: light check-ins versus deeper, more vulnerable territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            We shipped the hybrid: questions first, with collection entry points visible but secondary, with richer filtering queued for the next release.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal stayed the same: help teachers find what they're looking for in under 20 seconds. That constraint guided every hierarchy decision (type scale, card density, whitespace) and kept the visual system focused.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The streamlined onboarding flow shipped before back-to-school season, and teacher setup completion improved significantly compared to the previous semester. The revised welcome question flow, where teachers add students and set up a magic link in one sitting, became the highest-impact entry point for new users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Content Library redesign shifted teacher behavior. Instead of abandoning the library after first use, teachers returned throughout the semester, browsing collections, sending more questions, building an ongoing practice rather than a one-time setup task.

        <section className="cs-section-block">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Building during a pandemic, when teachers were overwhelmed with new tools, new systems, and no spare capacity, taught me that onboarding is often the most important product surface. Teachers had 30 seconds of patience. Getting them through setup fast enough to send their first invite to students was the clearest signal of whether they'd stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deeper lesson was about emotional design in institutional contexts. Along needed to feel like a conversation, not a compliance tool. The rounded serifs, the soft palette, the checkbox that created momentum: these details carried the product's intent more than any feature list could.
